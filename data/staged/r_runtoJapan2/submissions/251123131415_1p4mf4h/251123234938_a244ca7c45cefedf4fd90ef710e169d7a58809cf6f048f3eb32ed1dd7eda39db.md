Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inform your university of a serious incident involving a
social media post made by an individual who appears to be drafting, or
may have submitted a peer-review report for an academic manuscript
authored at Kyushu University. The post contains explicitly
anti-Japanese statements and indicates an intention to discriminate
against manuscripts originating from Japanese institutions.

In the post, the individual openly states that he intends to “resist
Japan through academic means”, declaring that he will reject any
submission from Japanese authors or Japanese institutions regardless of
its scientific quality. He frames this as an active effort to oppose
Japan through academic activity.

Attached to this email are three screenshots of the post. The first
image shows a Chinese-language draft of a peer-review report, presented
in numbered paragraphs (this may constitute a breach of peer-review
confidentiality). He describes it as an intentional rejection, although
it is unclear whether he is still drafting or has actually submitted it
to the journal. The content includes detailed scientific critique, which
may assist your institution in identifying which manuscript and which
research group were being referred to. Based on the terminology and
context, the subject of the manuscript appears to relate to
environmental engineering and material-based pollutant removal
technologies, with ciprofloxacin as the contaminant under study.

The second screenshot displays the author affiliations, which include
multiple departments of Kyushu University. I identified your university
as the appropriate recipient specifically because these affiliations
appear directly in the images posted by the individual.

The social media profile shown in the third screenshot indicates the
individual’s affiliation as Southwest Petroleum University (though this
cannot be confirmed) , which may help the journal locate the reviewer if
an investigation is necessary.

I am bringing this matter to your attention because such discriminatory
public statements directly targeting scholars at Japanese institutions
may amount to academic unfairness. If you are able to identify or
contact the authors involved, it may be advisable for them to notify the
journal’s editorial office promptly should they believe that their
manuscript was treated unfairly.

Please find all screenshots attached for your reference.

Sincerely, A concerned observer
