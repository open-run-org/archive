> I visited Japan last summer, and while there I bought some street food and found a spot nearby to eat. As I did so, a local approached and asked if he could talk with me as he wanted to practice his English a bit; not a problem! While we talked, he mentioned how what I was eating is basically unaffordable for someone like him, which surprised me. We both worked in the same field (IT/computer software), and he was a few years older than me. I make a decent salary in the U.S. and was aware of the exchange rate, but it still felt wrong that he felt unable to afford some grilled meat on a stick. When we compared salaries, I was gobsmacked to see that he made barely over HALF what I did, despite his comparative seniority (not to mention he had skills that I still don't have like coding!).
