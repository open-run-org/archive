你好

比来、日本原住民注視来日移民動向、就中倦厭景況悪化與競争激化之中国人。
日本経済新聞特集「日本華僑百萬人時代」、紹介漢化日本街地・華僑集住地域。

我抱関心於華僑集住地域、故欲其接触手法。

(Someone told me off for my 擬古文言, so I write in English too)

Hello.

Recently, indigenous Japanese people have been concerned about incoming immirants, in particular those chinese diaspora who dislike and defect from China's heavy and severe competition and economic depression.

NIKKEI features "One Million Chinese in Japan Era" series which introduces some districts being sinonised and Chinese dwellers' settlements.

I'm interested in those communities, and want to know how to approach them.
