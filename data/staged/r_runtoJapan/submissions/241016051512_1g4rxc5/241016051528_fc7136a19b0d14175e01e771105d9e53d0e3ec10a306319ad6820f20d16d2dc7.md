中文翻译：

我是 u/Pristine_Jicama_8252，我是 reddit 用户、r/real\_China\_irl 成员和 r/runtoJapan 版主。

我衷心希望取消对 r/real_China_irl 的封禁，我希望这个子站由 r/real_China_irl 的成员自己拥有，而不是 r/China_irl。

一提到REAL，我们总会联想到FAKE，这意味着不认可。

r/real_China_irl就是在这种背景下诞生的，因为对China\_irl的种种行为的不认同而被创建和使用，并逐渐形成了较大的影响力。

虽然这种影响非常有限，但real\_China\_irl的成员还不到China\_irl的五分之一，从这个角度上说，我们是绝对的少数派。

我们尊重并理解China\_irl的存在，但因为不认同，我们创建了一个新的sub，选择了另一种表达自由。

同样，我担任mod的 r/runtoJapan 也是一个更加少数的群体--我们的主要成员来自生活在日本的中国人和希望生活在日本的中国人。就整个 Reddit 的中文社区而言，这显然是极少数。

然而，充分的言论自由和细分也为我们带来了非凡的社区活力。就发帖量而言，其他华人社区的成员加起来还不到 China\_irl 的一半，但他们却贡献了大量高质量的内容和讨论。

我不想在这里过多地讨论China\_irl和r/real\_China\_irl或其他华人社区之间到底有什么分歧和不同--因为这是广泛的差异，可以说是生活方式上的差异，而不是大家所理解的所谓政治--老实说，这些社区内部甚至没有统一的政治观点，更不用说它们之间有什么分歧了。

然而，China\_irl 已经打击了几个sub--它甚至在几年前制定了一项荒谬的规定：当它的成员被机器人检测到在其他中文社区（他们称之为 “煽动仇恨的社区”）的特定部分发言时，这些用户将被永久封禁。

这种行为导致了多个细分sub的产生--事实证明，这些子模板中的大多数只是在侧重讨论不同的内容而已，并没有什么分歧。

对于中文社区的其他sub来说，以强凌弱的China\_irl无疑是社区多样性和言论自由的破坏者。

作为少数派，我们尊重 China\_irl 成员在自己的社区中交流讨论和发布内容，也希望我们能得到应有的尊重。然而，这个想法几乎是不可能实现的--现在，隶属于China\_irl的成员正试图恢复real\_China\_irl并取得mod--这无异于将real\_China\_irl变成China\_irl的一个分部，这是在夺取China\_irl的控制权。

我在这里为 real\_China\_irl 发声，也同样为其他中文社区仗义执言。

不要让与 China\_irl 相关的用户成为 real\_China\_irl 的mod。

我们为自己发声。

我们需要您的帮助。

  
祝好。



原文：

I’m [](/user/Pristine_Jicama_8252/) and I am a reddit user, member of [](/r/real_China_irl/)and mediator for [](/r/runtoJapan/).

I sincerely hope that unbanned the [](/r/real_China_irl/), and I want the sub to be owned by members of [](/r/real_China_irl/) their selves - not [](/r/China_irl/).

When we mention REAL, we always think of something being FAKE, which implies disapproval.

[](/r/real_China_irl/) was born in this context, created and used because of the disapproval of China\_irl's various doings, and gradually became more influential.

Although this influence is very limited, real\_China\_irl's membership is less than one-fifth of China\_irl's, in this sense, we are an absolute minority.

We respect and understand the existence of China\_irl, but because we do not agree, we have created a new sub to choose another freedom of expression.

Similarly, [](/r/runtoJapan/), where I serve as a mod, is an even more minority group - our main members come from Chinese living in Japan and Chinese wishing to live in Japan. In terms of the entirety of Reddit's Chinese community, this is clearly a tiny minority.

However, the full freedom of expression and segmentation has also given us remarkable community vitality. In terms of post count, the rest of the Chinese community with less than half the combined membership of China\_irl contributes a great deal of quality content and discussion.

I don't want to go into too much detail here about what exactly divides and differs between China\_irl and [](/r/real_China_irl/) or other Chinese communities – because it's a wide range of differences, a difference in lifestyles if you will, rather than the so-called politics as everyone understands it - and to be honest, there isn't even a unified political viewpoint within these communities, let alone any differences between them.

However, China\_irl has cracked down on a handful of subs - it even put in place a ridiculous rule a few years ago that when its members are detected by bots speaking in specific parts of other Chinese communities (which they call 'hate-mongering communities'), those users will be permanently banned.

This behavior has led to the creation of several sub templates - it turns out that most of these subs are just discussing different things and with different emphases.

For the rest of the Chinese community, China\_irl that dominates and bullies the weak is undoubtedly a destroyer of community diversity and freedom of speech.

As a minority, we respect China\_irl members for exchanging discussions and posting content in their own community, and we hope that we can be treated with the respect we deserve. However, this idea is almost unattainable - right now, members affiliated with China\_irl are trying to revive real\_China\_irl and gain control - this is tantamount to turning real\_China\_irl into a division of China\_irl, which is seizing.

I am here to speak up for real\_China\_irl, and equally for the rest of the minority Chinese community.

Don't let users associated with China\_irl become mods of real\_China\_irl.

We speak for ourselves.

We need your help.

 

Best wishes to you.
