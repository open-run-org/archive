Hi.

I'm thinking of going to Beijing for tourism from Tokyo, taking advantage of visa-free admission.

However, when I look up the ticket price in Trip.cow, the return trip to there costs me around 30 to 50％ as much as that to Shanghai or HK.

Hmm…why is it? It's because the less competitive pressure on airlines? (that is, there are fewer services between Tokyo and Beijing than those toward the aforementioned cities)
