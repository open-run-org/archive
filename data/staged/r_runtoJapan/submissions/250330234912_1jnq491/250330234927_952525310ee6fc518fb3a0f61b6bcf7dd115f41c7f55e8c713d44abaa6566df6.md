Hi

As you may know and be one of them, people in the East Asia have been fascinated with Japan-originated idolatry contents indurstry.

Yesterday I visited Saitama Super Arena for a certain reason, and I heard some people speak Chinese(Mandarin?). now it's no longer rare nor strange.

However, it's still less frequent for such Japanese 2D idols to hold their live performance in China proper or somewhere else aborad, except for Vtubers. 

What do you think of this? what do you think would be a key point to the promotion and export of Japan's live performance industry? Do you reckon that you can help it anyway?
