Hi Everyone,

I’m currently working on a TV project about the “run-ri” (潤日) phenomenon. Since I’m not very familiar with this topic, I would love to hear your insights.

I’d like to better understand the main reasons why Chinese people choose to move to Japan. I’ve heard that education is one of the main motivations, but I’m also curious about other factors such as investment opportunities, political reasons, or even patriotism. Could you share concrete examples?

I’m especially interested in testimonies from people who are in the process of moving to Japan, as well as from those who have already settled there and can share why they made this choice.

I would also like to know if there are any strategies from the Japanese government or embassy to facilitate this movement—such as programs, agencies, recruitment campaigns, or intermediaries that make the process easier.For now, my goal is simply to understand the phenomenon, but later I may bring the subject to life through a TV production. So, no worries—this first exchange is just for information. 

However, if you’re open to a TV interview later on, that could also be an option.I’m interested in hearing from all kinds of profiles: students, parents, intellectuals, wealthy individuals, middle-class families, and more.

Thank you so much for your help!

大家好，

我正在制作一个关于“润日”现象的电视项目。由于我对这个话题不是很熟悉，非常希望能听到大家的见解。我想更好地了解中国人选择移居日本的主要原因。

据我所知，教育是其中一个重要动机，但我也对其他因素感兴趣，比如投资机会、政治原因，甚至是爱国情怀。能否分享一些具体的例子？我特别希望能够听到两类人的经历：一类是正在准备去日本、办理相关手续的人，另一类是已经定居日本、可以讲述自己选择原因的人。

另外，我也想知道日本政府或日本大使馆是否有相关政策或措施来推动这种移居，比如一些项目、机构、招聘活动，或是中介机构来帮助简化流程。目前我的目标只是先了解这一现象，之后可能会通过电视报道的形式来展现出来。

所以，请大家放心，这次交流只是为了收集信息。当然，如果您以后也愿意接受电视采访，那也将非常欢迎。我希望能听到各种不同人群的声音：学生、家长、知识分子、富裕人士、中产阶级等。

非常感谢大家的帮助！
