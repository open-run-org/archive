I am a 28 years old Chinese girl with master degree in finance now working in a top crypto company (boss and colleagues oversea) in China. 
I came from a so called poor ( low social class) family in China. 
I got blessed and I was really hardworking back in the days so I got into one of the best uni in China and then went to a business school in Spain. 

Honestly I think my greatest strength is languages and I guess I am not stupid. After few years of working in crypto space. I gathered some money ( less than 1 million usd) 

But recently I am so tired of this work and living in China ( tho I admit I am still positive on the futures of China) 

I list a few options : 
1. Go to Tokyo and study Japanese and hopefully can immigrate there ( Jp housing and life is affordable for me) I can buy a house  there and the culture of Japan is quite similar to that of China 

2. Go to the US and be an entrepreneur. 
I always wanted to go to the US yet when I had the opportunity I was so poor and can’t afford the tuition there. 
I tot about being an entrepreneur of either in AIGC or in Crypto 

3. Stay in China and totally lie fiat 


Please give me some advice dear fellow. I really think I am on the edge of having a mental breakdown as I think I am a  such loser. Being a single independent women is hard in China
