Right now I have resigned from a big internet company for a period of time in an effort to prepare for my PhD application. Recently, I got an internship chance as a research assistant from a Singapore university. But when I look through the TEP application materials, I notice that it needs people who are either students or trainees of an institution. I’m a bit worried that I might not qualify. I really cherish this opportunity, is there anyone who met similar circumstances but finally managed to apply for TEP? I really appreciate your help! I do not have any visit pass of Singapore.
