The deportation statistics for the United States from 2000 to 2024 show significant fluctuations over the years. Here's a breakdown of the available data:

Early 2000s

During the presidency of George W. Bush (2001-2008), approximately 2.0 million people were deported1.

Obama Administration (2009-2016)

The Obama administration saw a significant increase in deportations:

About 3.2 million people were deported during Obama's presidency1

In Obama's first three years in office, around 1.18 million people were deported1

Over 2.5 million undocumented immigrants were deported during his entire tenure1

Trump Administration (2017-2020)

Deportation numbers decreased during Trump's presidency:

Around 800,000 deportations took place in Trump's first three years1

In the final year of his presidency, Trump deported an additional 186,000 immigrants1

The total for Trump's full presidency was just under 1 million deportations1

Biden Administration (2021-2024)

Deportation numbers have increased significantly under Biden:

In less than 26 months, the Biden administration's Department of Homeland Security made over 5 million arrests1

The Biden administration is deporting people at a rate 3.5 times higher each month than under Trump1

It's important to note that the exact year-by-year breakdown for the entire period from 2000 to 2024 is not provided in the given search results. However, the data shows clear trends and significant differences between administrations. The Obama administration had the highest number of deportations, followed by a decrease during the Trump years, and then a sharp increase under Biden.
