最近的报道，大专妹申请澳洲旅游签被拒，创业哥户头70万人民币申请旅游签一样被拒。

"My feeling is the difference \[in the refusal rate\] is roughly 30 to 50 per cent."

Mr Dong questioned whether visa refusals were increasing because more tourists were staying in Australia once they arrived.

"I guess it has something to do with many \[people\] coming with a tourist visa, but later seeking asylum and staying to work," Mr Dong said.
