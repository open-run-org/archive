我是西北大专大一光伏工程技术专业的大一学生我问Grok十万预算它推荐我去读澳大利亚，加拿大的college半工半读，我感觉是不是这有些乐观，我家长只能拿出十万，真的有可能去半工半读吗？
还是直接大专毕业去这俩国家工作，抽WHV签证，但我感觉大概率无法从事安装光伏板，但去屠宰场，农场，快餐店也挺好。穷有穷的润法
希望有高人指点，不省感激 （I'm a freshman majoring in Photovoltaic
Engineering Technology at a college in Northwest China. I asked Grok
about my budget of 100,000 yuan. He recommended that I study part-time
at a college in Australia or Canada. I think this might be a bit
optimistic. My parents can only come up with 100,000 yuan. Is it really
possible for me to study part-time? It's still better to go directly to
work in these two countries after graduating from junior college and
apply for a WHV visa. But I think it's highly likely that I won't be
able to install photovoltaic panels. However, going to a slaughterhouse,
a farm, or a fast food restaurant is also quite good. Even in poverty,
there is a way to nourish the Dharma. I hope to receive guidance from a
wise person. I am deeply grateful）
