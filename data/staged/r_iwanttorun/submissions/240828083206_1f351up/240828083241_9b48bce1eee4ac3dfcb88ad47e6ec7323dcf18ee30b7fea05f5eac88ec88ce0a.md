Under the policy, the government will cap new international students at 175,000 for higher education courses and 95,000 for the skills training sector, taking the total to 270,000, Education Minister Jason Clare said Tuesday.

Overall, there will be about 15% more students allowed for universities and 20% fewer for vocational colleges in 2025, Clare said. The government was writing to individual universities to inform them of their caps on Tuesday.

That limit on higher education visas implied a 13% cut from the fiscal year that ended in June, much lower than the 20-25% decline forecast previously by student services provider IDP Education Ltd., said Entcho Raykovski, analyst at Evans & Partners Pty Ltd. IDP shares jumped as much as 14% in Sydney, to the highest level in more than three months.
