An exemption from additional tuition fees will be granted, effective in September 2023, to foreign students enrolled in a college or university institution located outside the territory of the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal. They will have to take a program of studies in French in the employment sectors identified as priorities by the Gouvernement du Québec, that is:

information technology
engineering
health and social services
education
educational childcare services
Thanks to this exemption, the foreign students who meet the criteria will pay the same tuition fees as Québec students.  This measure will take effect in the fall 2023 session.

Conditions of eligibility
To be eligible, you must meet the following conditions:

be a foreign student registered in a college or university institution
be registered full time in a program of studies in French related to one of the fields identified as priorities by the Gouvernement du Québec;
your places of learning and residence must be located in Québec, outside the territory of the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal
The conditions to benefit from the exemption will be published soon.
