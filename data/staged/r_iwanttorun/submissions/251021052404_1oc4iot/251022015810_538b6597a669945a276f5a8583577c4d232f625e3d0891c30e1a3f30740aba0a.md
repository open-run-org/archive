<https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/asylum/affirmative-asylum-interview-scheduling>

我看到USCIS官网上写的是

On the first track, USCIS generally schedules asylum interviews in the
following order of priority:

- **First priority**: Applications that were scheduled for an interview,
  but the interview had to be rescheduled at the applicant’s request or
  the needs of USCIS.
- **Second priority**: Applications that have been pending 21 days or
  fewer.
- **Third priority**: All other pending affirmative asylum applications,
  starting with newer filings and working back towards older filings.

如果第21天还没安排上面谈，是不是一年内获得面谈的希望就很渺茫了？
