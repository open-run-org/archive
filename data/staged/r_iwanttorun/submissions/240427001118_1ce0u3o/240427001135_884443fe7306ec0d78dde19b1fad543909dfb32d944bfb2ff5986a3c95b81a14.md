发到英文社区没人理我…懒得打字直接把英文粘贴过来了。反正各位润友应该都是懂英格律师的吧。

Recently struggling with emotional problems and suffering from insomnia becuz of that. So here's the background. I'm an intern medical student and she was my supervisor in a department, only four years older than me. We still stay in touch after I finish my period there and have no gap chatting. I sum up reasons why I'm quite depressed in this issue.
1. Got a crush on her but have no idea how to take action. (As a doc she got hectic schedule and it's hard to date her. She have much richer social experience, knowing a lot more that I don't know, like some behind the scenes in hospital or trends in medical system. I feel like I'm a dumbass mf knowing nothing and sometimes feel unconfident in front of her. This invisible pressure make me appear clumsy automatically put myself in an inferior place, doing things just to catch her fancy.) 
2. I think she has little to no idea that I got some feelings for her and just see me as a decent friend. 3. Gotta finish my intern career and leave the place she work in a month later so there's no much time left to be with her. 
4. Can't stop the delusion. Keep daydreaming about some happily ever after.

How to get her out of my mind? / How to make her my gf or at least give it a shot?
