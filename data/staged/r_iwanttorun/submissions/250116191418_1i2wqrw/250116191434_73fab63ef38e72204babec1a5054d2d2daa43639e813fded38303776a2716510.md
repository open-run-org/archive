Marc Bernhard, the AfD member of the Bundestag from Karlsruhe, confirmed the distribution campaign. 20,000-30,000 flyers were printed. They were distributed at campaign stands and thrown into mailboxes. However, there was no specific search for foreign-sounding names on mailboxes. Bernhard told SWR that it was election advertising for everyone.
