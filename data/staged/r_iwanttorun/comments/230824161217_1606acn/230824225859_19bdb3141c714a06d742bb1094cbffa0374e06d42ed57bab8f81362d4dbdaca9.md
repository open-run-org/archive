> 官网说的很清楚呀，你满足在同一工作类型（same NOC）工作1560小时就行。假设你在A公司和B公司都是干的电工，理论上就没问题。但假设你在A公司是电工B公司是木工的话就不行。
> at least 1 year of continuous work or 1,560 hours total (30 hours per week)—you can meet this in a few different ways:
> full-time at 1 job: 30 hours/week for 12 months = 1 year full-time (1,560 hours)
> equal amount in part-time work: for example 15 hours/week for 24 months = 1 year full time (1,560 hours)
> You can work as many part-time jobs as you need to meet this requirement
> full-time at more than 1 job: 30 hours/week for 12 months at more than 1 job = 1 year full time (1,560 hours)
