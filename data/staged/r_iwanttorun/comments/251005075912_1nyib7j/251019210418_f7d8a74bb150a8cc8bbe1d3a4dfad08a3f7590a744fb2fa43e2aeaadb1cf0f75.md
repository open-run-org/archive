> 从表达上没什么奇怪的。不知道你是从哪里看出来。你要非要挑毛病，那我想说可能是“and she did it”。一般来说更期待要么把这句黏到上一句。要么重起一句。还有前面的“some”微奇怪。不过这都是小问题，您老人家不是也知道他想说啥吗。人家估计也是正经上了学，比我当年英语好多了。

Doing it right exactly on the day we chinese beat Japanese like dog, totally look down on our chinese to our face, even Angela Merkel couldn't be this shameless hoe i guess.

> >For anyone who doesn't know, she went to a shrine that honors some WWII war criminals, and she did it on the exact day Japan surrendered in 1945. Can you imagine a German leader doing that? 

> >analyze this writing and determine whether it's written by a native speaker, if not, what language is most likely to be the first language of the writer?

> This writing is **very likely written by a native English speaker**.

> Here's a brief analysis:

> * **Natural Flow and Phrasing:** The sentence structure and word choices ("For anyone who doesn't know," "honors some WWII war criminals," "exact day Japan surrendered," "Can you imagine a German leader doing that?") are all completely natural and idiomatic in English.
> * **Use of "Exact":** The use of "exact" in "on the **exact** day" is a common native-speaker way of adding emphasis.
> * **Question Structure:** The final rhetorical question, "Can you imagine a German leader doing that?", is perfectly constructed and naturally placed to emphasize the writer's point.
> * **Punctuation and Capitalization:** The use of commas, capitalization, and the question mark is standard English.

> There are no grammatical errors, unnatural word order, or awkward phrasings that would typically indicate a non-native speaker.

> Therefore, the writer's first language is **most likely English**.
