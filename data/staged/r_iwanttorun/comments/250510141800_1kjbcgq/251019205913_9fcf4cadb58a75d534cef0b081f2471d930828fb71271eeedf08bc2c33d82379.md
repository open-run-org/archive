> > 比较靠谱的方式是B学校的方案，这种只要A愿意配合问题不是特别大。

> 问题是 A 校愿意配合吗？如果把A 校 offer 拒了，A 校会不会把 SEVIS revoke，那就没法完成 A 校注册了。

> 1. You can’t just enter the U.S. on School A’s I-20 and switch to School B immediately

> The F-1 visa is school-specific, meaning:

> Your visa and I-20 must match the school you intend to attend.

> If you enter the U.S. on School A’s I-20, you are expected to attend School A at least for one full term (or get a transfer properly arranged).



> 2. Here’s how to switch properly (and legally):

> Option A: Before entering the U.S.

> Ask School B to issue you an I-20.

> Use that new I-20 to apply for an updated F-1 visa (if your current visa has School A's SEVIS ID and School B's SEVIS ID is different).

> Or if you haven't gotten the visa yet: use the I-20 from School B to apply.

> Then enter the U.S. with School B's documents.
