{"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "runtoJapan2", "selftext": "Dear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to inform your university of a serious incident involving a social media post made by an individual who appears to be drafting, or may have submitted a peer-review report for an academic manuscript authored at Kyushu University. The post contains explicitly anti-Japanese statements and indicates an intention to discriminate against manuscripts originating from Japanese institutions.\n\nIn the post, the individual openly states that he intends to \u201cresist Japan through academic means\u201d, declaring that he will reject any submission from Japanese authors or Japanese institutions regardless of its scientific quality. He frames this as an active effort to oppose Japan through academic activity.\n\nAttached to this email are three screenshots of the post. The first image shows a Chinese-language draft of a peer-review report, presented in numbered paragraphs (this may constitute a breach of peer-review confidentiality). He describes it as an intentional rejection, although it is unclear whether he is still drafting or has actually submitted it to the journal. The content includes detailed scientific critique, which may assist your institution in identifying which manuscript and which research group were being referred to. Based on the terminology and context, the subject of the manuscript appears to relate to environmental engineering and material-based pollutant removal technologies, with ciprofloxacin as the contaminant under study.\n\nThe second screenshot displays the author affiliations, which include multiple departments of Kyushu University. I identified your university as the appropriate recipient specifically because these affiliations appear directly in the images posted by the individual.\n\nThe social media profile shown in the third screenshot indicates the individual\u2019s affiliation as Southwest Petroleum University (though this cannot be confirmed) , which may help the journal locate the reviewer if an investigation is necessary.\n\nI am bringing this matter to your attention because such discriminatory public statements directly targeting scholars at Japanese institutions may amount to academic unfairness. If you are able to identify or contact the authors involved, it may be advisable for them to notify the journal\u2019s editorial office promptly should they believe that their manuscript was treated unfairly.  \n\nPlease find all screenshots attached for your reference.\n\nSincerely,\nA concerned observer", "author_fullname": "t2_fq2x8npe2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0,
