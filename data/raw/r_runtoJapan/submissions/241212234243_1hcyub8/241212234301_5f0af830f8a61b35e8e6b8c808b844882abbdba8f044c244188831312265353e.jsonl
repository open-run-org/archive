We married and live together, my family came all the way across the world to meet her family. And I remember my father asking her father if they're religious , amongst other questions, if they were religious we wouldn't even bat an eye, it's just a normal question, but my wife's father said they're not.\nAnd my wife also told my parents she doesn't have any religion.\n\nSpoiler alert, she is religious and her whole family is.\nAbout a half year ago she came to me and said \"I have to confess something\" she told me at first she was a Buddhist and stuff , and that she believed in Nichiren etc etc. \nMe as a foreigner in Japan doesn't know anything about it so I thought she was just a Buddhist. (obviously i was pissed and shocked that she and her whole family basically just lied to me and my family)\nLater on she would then say she's not a Buddhist but believe in something called SGI or Soka gakkai, at the time I've never heard of it.\nI wasn't alarmed by it , except for that she lied to me, but the weird thing was that right away she was like \"but it's not bad religion!\" And \"But we are not crazy\"  even though I didn't say anything, so obviously this makes me curious and suspicious.\nSo I asked her why she lied about not telling me her religion, and she told me that she believed I wouldn't marry her or I would hate her if she told me from the beginning (I wouldn't have).\nShe basically said she had been chanting an hour per time, 2 times a day , every morning before I woke up, without me knowing.\nI believe her mom and dad pressured her into telling me, because they're always texting and have some sort of local group chat with other members.\n\nI didn't know what to do with this situation so I just accepted it.\nI started looking it up online and asking my friends about SGI, I felt there must be something wrong with this religion, why else did she seem so worried about telling me ? (She was also extremely anxious and panicky when I told my parents on the phone that she believed in something called SGI, saying that my parents might hate her because of it, despite my parents having no clue about this religion).\nBasically every answer I got from friend and from online was negative , but there's never been a explanation to why it's negative, I heard things about it being a cult and stuff.\n\nMy wife also now just openly chants in our house, twice a day, she tried to get me to join her but I'm not about to do that. I told her it's her freedom to do so, but honestly I don't like it when's she's chanting, it kinda creeps me out and sounds frankly quite cringe.\nThe sound she makes is kinda like one sentence but she repeats it for an hour really rapidly.\n\nI asked my wife to tell me what this religion was but she said she didn't know how to explain so she asked members of the local SGI organization to come over to our house and explain to me.\nThey were all nice elderly people but they obviously tried to recruit me into it with gifts and books and stuff.\nAlso I had tons of questions like, why would my wife hide her religion, and why do I read so much negativity about this online.\nMy wife's parents and the people she invited to our home were basically very dismissive and were just like: oh, they're just haters, but it's all fake, SGI is good, just a lot of Japanese people spread lies about our religion.\nSo I never got an answer to my questions.\n\nFew months later my wife and her parents wanted us to have some kind of altar or shrine dedicated to the religion in our home. So I had to go with her and her parents to a local church like building, many people were there and they were all quite nice.\nI just didn't really know what was going on, they congratulated me on marrying, and some members exchanged contact with me.\nThen guess what, my the person who turned out to be the leader of this local organization is my wife's father.\nHe started giving speeches and talking about a guy called Ikeda Sensei (some people started cheering aggressively or crying when his picture was shown on the TV 😅,  reminded me of what you see about North Korea)  after that all people started chanting the same way my wife did, I felt extremely uncomfortable and weird , I'm just sitting there while everyone makes these sounds. One of the guys sitting next to me was like \" it's okay, just copy after me\" so I politely refused saying I was shy, while in reality I was just extremely cringed.\nAfter that we got the shrine, which is now set up in our home, and my wife prays to it daily.\nSome of the guys that I exchanged contact with message me once I a while to ask me out to go to a religious meeting, but I refuse everytime. \n\nA few times me and my wife got into an argument about this, like she gets extremely defensive when I asked her about why this religion is considered controversial.\nShe also mentioned that she wants our kids to go to these meetings as soon as they're born, I'm strongly against that.\nEverytime we argue about this relgion she also says , maybe you shouldn't have married an SGI girl like me, to which I reply maybe I shouldn't , she then always immediately regrets saying it and goes like \"plz don't leave me etc. etc.\nIt annoys me that she always brings up divorce when I tell her I don't like her religion but she then immediately regrets it and doesn't want to actually divorce ( I don't want either ).\nAt this point I'm obviously very much against SGI since it's causing us arguments in our marriage.\n\nSorry for the long post, really needed to get this off my chest. I'm just at a point where I don't know what to do , and I still don't even know why everything is so secretive.\nIf someone here as any knowledge about these people and can tell me what I got into please let me know.\nSeriously worried if I married into some weird doomsday cult or something.\nHow deep into the 💩 am I?","selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So this is gonna be a long post but I need this off my chest, I have so many unanswered questions and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on so I&#39;ll start from the beginning.\nI came to Japan more than 2 years ago and met a girl , we hit it off, and decided to marry fairly quickly.\nI&#39;ve now been married for a year and she&#39;s perfect, extremely caring, understanding and polite.\nWhile we were still not married I asked her if she had a religion, just a normal date question, she said no, which I liked since I&#39;m not religious or spiritual at all.\nI met her parents and apparently they were also not religious.
