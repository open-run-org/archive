After few years of working in crypto space. I gathered some money ( less than 1 million usd) \n\nBut recently I am so tired of this work and living in China ( tho I admit I am still positive on the futures of China) \n\nI list a few options : \n1. Go to Tokyo and study Japanese and hopefully can immigrate there ( Jp housing and life is affordable for me) I can buy a house  there and the culture of Japan is quite similar to that of China \n\n2. Go to the US and be an entrepreneur. \nI always wanted to go to the US yet when I had the opportunity I was so poor and can’t afford the tuition there. \nI tot about being an entrepreneur of either in AIGC or in Crypto \n\n3. Stay in China and totally lie fiat \n\n\nPlease give me some advice dear fellow. I really think I am on the edge of having a mental breakdown as I think I am a  such loser. Being a single independent women is hard in China\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"runtoJapan","subreddit_id":"t5_7eixzl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/runtoJapan","subreddit_subscribers":13190,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"spoiler","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"SOS WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY FUTURES","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"ups":0,"upvote_ratio":0.4000000059604645,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/runtoJapan/comments/1dvsn88/sos_what_should_i_do_with_my_futures/","user_reports":[],"view_count":null,"visited":false,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
