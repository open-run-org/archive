I wanted to share something I built with Claude that's become an essential part of my daily life.\n\n## The backstory\n\nMy girlfriend is Japanese, I'm Chinese. She only speaks Japanese and is learning Chinese, while I speak Chinese and English fluently, and I'm learning Japanese. We're both dedicated to learning each other's native languages, but regular apps don't understand our inside jokes, nicknames, or conversation context. We needed something more personal that would help us practice daily.\n\n## Enter Aini - our custom chat app\n\nWith Claude as my pair programmer, I built **Aini**, an app specifically designed for us to learn each other's languages. Here's what makes it special:\n\n### Enforced Language Days\n- Chinese days: Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun\n- Japanese days: Tue, Thu, Sat\n- The entire interface switches languages automatically - no cheating!\n\n### Context-Aware AI Translation\nWhen you try to send a message in the wrong language, the app intercepts it and provides:\n- A translation that understands our conversation history\n- Explanations of WHY it's translated that way\n- Option to accept or reject before sending\n\n### Gentle Second Language Correction\nThis is my favorite feature. When Yoshimi writes Chinese on Chinese days (her second language), the app offers corrections with:\n- Specific mistakes highlighted (strikethrough → correction)\n- Grammar tips and natural alternatives\n- Encouraging, supportive feedback\n- Same for my Japanese on Japanese days!\n\n### Real-time Anki Integration\nWhen I'm studying Japanese flashcards on my computer, a subtle bubble appears in the chat showing Yoshimi what I'm learning. It's like studying together even when apart.\n\n### All the Modern Features\n- Real-time messaging with Socket.IO\n- Reply to specific messages\n- Image sharing (paste from clipboard!)\n- Auto emoji conversion (because typing :rofl: is faster)\n- Discord-like markdown support\n- PWA with push notifications\n- Offline support\n\n## How Claude Made This Possible\n\nClaude was helful in every aspect:\n\n1. **Architecture**: Helped design the TypeScript/Next.js structure with proper type safety\n2. **Database**: Created SQLite schema with a robust migration system\n3. **Real-time**: Implemented Socket.IO with JWT authentication\n4. **AI Integration**: Structured LLM API calls for context-aware translations, grammar tips, and explanations\n5. **PWA Features**: Set up service workers, offline support, and push notifications\n6. **Custom Isormorphic Logging**: Built a logging system that works both client and server-side for easier debugging (especially on phones...). all logs are sent to journald with proper priority level and structures. Client-side logs are buffered and sent in batches.\n8. **Testing**: Unit tests and end-to-end integration tests with Jest and Playwright to ensure reliability across updates\n7. **Deployment**: Configured production deployment on AWS EC2\n\nEvery line of code was pair-programmed with Claude.\n\nI have been on the 20x max plan for two months already. I iterated on the app for a month every now and then after my web dev work, shipping a new version every few days and testing with my partner. It's amazing how much productivity Claude Code unlocked for me. It's otherwise impossible for me to build something like this in such a short time.\n\n## The Impact\n\nShe loves the app (the most important part!). At the first week or so it was a bit buggy, but it soon got usable and surpassed our other chat apps. We would have most of our daily conversations there now.\n\nAini provides a seamless and private space for us to communicate and learn without any barriers. I have definitely gotten better at reading Japanese over the past month.\n\nThe one lament is there isn't yet a gif search function. She sometimes switches to other apps just to send cute gifs lol.\n\n\n## Technical Stack\n- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind\n- Backend: Custom Node.js server with Socket.IO\n- Database: SQLite with custom migrations system\n- AI: API calls with structured output\n- Deployment: AWS EC2\n\n## Workflow, Tips, and Advices\n\nI have been using Claude Code on various projects. I find it very reliable on popular tech stacks like TypeScript/Node.js/React (compared to, say, Rust projects).\n\nOne opinion I have is on compacting. I don't think it's something you need to avoid at all cost. The relevant file contexts and todos passed down from the last iteration serves as a quick start for re-learning the task. If you were to start fresh, you would need to either manually explain the context again or let it take longer time to re-learn the context.\n\nIt is especially less scary when you have a good test coverage to ensure nothing goes wrong.\n\nHowever, Claude Code is very lazy with integration tests...\n\nIt will often try to passively handle or circumvent the failing tests by 1. adding more timeout 2. completely \"simplify\" the failing test cases for it to pass, or 3. simply conclude with failing tests and give some excuses like \"All the main features are working\".\n\nI don't blame it though. Understanding the UI and UX from the source code is a very daunting task.\n\nI would suggest integration tests in a Claude Code project to be completely written by yourself. You can ask Claude Code to help you write a draft, but editing manually is a good idea.\n\n\n## The Name\n\n\"Aini\" (爱你) means \"love you\" in Chinese. Seemed fitting for an app that brings us closer while learning.\n\n---\n\nIf you're in a similar situation (international couple, learning languages, or just need a private chat app), I'm happy to share more details about the implementation!\n\nThe video has subtitles in all three languages, English, Chinese, and Japanese!","selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/ClaudeAI\">r/ClaudeAI</a>!
