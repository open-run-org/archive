A young girl dropped her very light umbrella, which you can see in the picture, and it touched the elderly woman's foot. The girl immediately apologized, but the umbrella was very light and obviously not something that would do much damage to the elderly woman's foot. However, the elderly woman reacted very dramatically. She yelled loudly, and everyone around her turned around at once, but then quickly looked away again.

The girl didn't understand what was going on and asked what the problem was. The elderly woman then said, \"You hurt my foot badly, and you need to pay for it.\" while pointing to a scar that was obviously months old. The girl apologized and tried to buy some time for the train to stop, but unfortunately the train stopped at Nakai station, and the older woman continued to approach the girl, becoming louder and more aggressive. I didn't know what to say because I wasn't very good at Japanese, but I hoped that someone would intervene. To my surprise, no one did.\n\nFinally, when I was approaching my stop, I wrote on my smartphone, \"Before giving your contact information to a stranger, you should consult your parents first. If you are in trouble, ask a station staff member for help\" and showed it to the girl. The girl looked at me with a frightened expression and trembling hands, and nodded. The older woman kept glaring at me, and didn't take her eyes off me until I got off the train and walked away through the window. I sincerely hope that the girl is safe and that some adult intervened and rectified the situation. If you see this older woman, please be careful. She is clearly mentally unstable.","selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sorry, English isn&#39;t my first language, but I saw something very strange yesterday on the train from Takadanobaba to Araiyakushi-mae.
