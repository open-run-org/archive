It was fine the first few years, but things changed when she became more stressed due to work. She gets annoyed when she comes home to see that I am relaxing in front of the TV with my son. I do all the domestic duties at home, food is always prepared on the table by the time she gets home. Now she looks down on me because she says I have no ambition in life. 10 years of supporting her passion. Now, time with family has become less and less. All I ask for is 1 hour of direct contact with my son, he's lucky to get 15 minutes a day with her now.\n\nI told her that I worked my butt off since I was a kid to create a financially free life, hence why I got married in my late 30s. I told her to quit her job and work for a different company in the same industry or enjoy life with me but she refuses to. She said she had made a commitment to her company and had to follow through with it. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️Why work for the company if you're always stressed out?\n\nNow our relationship has become sort of like distant flatmates. She sees me more like a maid than a human being. She does things without notifying me most of the time, it has become very frustrating. My son and I often travel overseas once a month to places like Korea, Taiwan, or places close by on weekends without her. She doesn't want to go because she says too tired to go or something came up at work and cancels the trip.\n\nI decided to go back to my country later in the year to setup things before my son moves over to start high-school.
