I am happy to provide firm or probono recommendations via DM, but nothing more). \n\nHi all, \n\nUsing a throwaway. I have been lurking here for a while without commenting anything, but I feel like I need to give my two cents given the amount of posts on this sub. Excuse any typos or grammatical errors. I am typing this while I am highly caffeinated and dealing with my own caseload. \n\nFellow immigration attorneys, please correct me if I'm wrong on any points. If you're not a legal professional, I do not want to hear it. \n\nFinally, none of this is legal advice. Please always consult with an attorney before making any decisions on your specific case. \n\n\n**1. Will DACA be taken away?**\n\nIMO, no-- the economy makes way too much money from DACA folks. I do believe that they will dangle it like a carrot to appease right-wing voters. Major corporations employ DACAmented folks. The SSN from work permits have allowed more tax revenue to come in. Too much is at stake. Legally, the legal arguments at the courts surrounding DACA involve constitutional rights, which themselves aren't going anywhere anytime soon. It's honestly just a topic that is often talked about, but hardly understood by many. \n\n**2. What about I-131F PIP?**\n\nToo soon to tell. There is likely to be a decision on the 8th. My hope is that they will allow adjudications until either January happens or another court stops them. \n\n**3. Will the mass deportations actually happen? Is it actually feasible?**\n\nI want to put this into perspective. There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. Currently, DHS has about 92,000 officers, and ICE has about 21,000 officers. It numerical and political suicide to try to achieve this. \n\nLet's say it actually does begin and people are getting rounded up. Guess what? Not all undocumented folks are just undocumented-- many have TPS, pending asylum applications, pending T/U Visas, and work permits (see my point regarding #1). Unless a migrant has an expedited removal (not likely), DHS/ICE still needs to process each deportee, assign them A#s, and follow basic procedures. If they don't? That's a very easy way to reverse a deportation order. It's the equivalent of convicting someone of murder using a confession made under a very obvious 4/5th amendment violation. Slam dunk case. \n\nOh, and you know who has to handle all of these deportation cases? Federal DHS attorneys. They're already overworked, and they tend to exercise discretion. If no discretion, the overworked ones tend to gloss over cases and provide weak arguments. Only major attention is paid to serious crimes. You'd be surprised the amount of times DHS attorneys have gotten my clients' names wrong or made procedurally embarrassing typos. \n\n**4. What about ICE roundups?**\n\nThey still happen. Still need to follow procedures. If not, lawsuits and lots of deportation reversals. \n\n**5. Will there be a plan to denaturalize? Is it actually feasible? What about birthright citizenship?**\n\nSee #1 and #3. \n\n**6. What is likely to happen coming January?**\n\nIMO, the end of prosecutorial discretion in deportation proceedings will likely happen immediately. This means that DHS attorneys will have to prosecute all cases. However, see my point for #3. \n\n**7. What will happen to my pending USCIS case? What will USCIS do now?**\n\nVaries. USCIS is highly understaffed right now, and the backlogs are ridiculous. My guess is that between now and December, there will be a push to try to get as many I-485/N400s adjudicated before January. This may result in fees increasing for future applications. \n\n**8. Should I try to file my [insert case here] with the USCIS?**\n\nI cannot answer this. I highly recommend an attorney. Unless your case involves a complex immigration history (think border apprehensions, previous deportations, court hearings or USCIS interviews), probono organizations may be able to take your case. \n\n**9. Can greencards be taken away?**\n\nGreencard refers to lawful permanent resident status (aka \"LPR\"). LPR status is given under a plethora amount of reasons-- each have their own statutory and common law requirements. Yes, theonewhoshallnotbenamed definitely enacted policies that made obtaining these harder, but not impossible. Again though, to take an LPR status, the USCIS is required to issue a Notice of Intent to Rescind, and it would allow you to argue your case. \n\nAgain, USCIS is backlogged. When backlogs continue, immigration attorneys threaten mandamus lawsuits. Who has to handle these? US Attorneys. Guess what they will try to do? Try to dismiss as quickly and easily as possible, bringing the process back to square one. What do lawyers hate (among many things)? Their success ratings going down. \n\n**10. I legit think that they're gonna throw the whole rulebook away and just try to remove DACA, deport people, and do whatever erratically.**\n\nThen we'll cross that bridge if we get to it. IMO, I never underestimated THAT ONE and his team. They are strategic and play the irrational and ludicrous card very well. Do I think they actually want to achieve the above? Definitely. However, I don't think it will come from the White House necessarily. They'll try to slowly change the social and political atmosphere, beginning at home. \n\nThis means that the revolution starts at home. It starts in how we educate ourselves and each other. It starts by breaking generational curses and preventing history from repeating itself. It means raising our children better. It means being in community. \n\n**11. I want to leave the US.**\n\nI can't blame you. I cannot give any information on this, and this is beyond the scope of this subreddit. \n\n**12. So, what now?**\n\nAs naive as it is for me to say, I think good always wins. The right is banking on your apathy, despair, and helplessness. \n\n**13. I'm glad that this is all happening. We need stricter immigration laws.**\n\nWhy are you in this sub? Let me know when you've joined the Olympics though, because the amount of mental gymnastics you are doing to justify your ignorance should be enough to give you a gold medal. \n\n\nEDIT: WOW. Lots of questions. I promise to try to get to as many as I can. I am but a mere attorney trying to meet his billable hours and trying to comfort my immigrant parents at the same time.
