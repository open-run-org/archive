I asked Grok about my budget of 100,000 yuan. He recommended that I study part-time at a college in Australia or Canada. I think this might be a bit optimistic.

It's still better to go directly to work in these two countries after graduating from junior college and apply for a WHV visa. But I think it's highly likely that I won't be able to install photovoltaic panels. However, going to a slaughterhouse, a farm, or a fast food restaurant is also quite good.
