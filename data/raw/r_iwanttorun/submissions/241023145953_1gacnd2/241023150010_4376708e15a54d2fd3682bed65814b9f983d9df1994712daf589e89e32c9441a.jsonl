Here's a breakdown of the available data:\n\nEarly 2000s\n\nDuring the presidency of George W. Bush (2001-2008), approximately 2.0 million people were deported1.\n\nObama Administration (2009-2016)\n\nThe Obama administration saw a significant increase in deportations:\n\nAbout 3.2 million people were deported during Obama's presidency1\n\nIn Obama's first three years in office, around 1.18 million people were deported1\n\nOver 2.5 million undocumented immigrants were deported during his entire tenure1\n\nTrump Administration (2017-2020)\n\nDeportation numbers decreased during Trump's presidency:\n\nAround 800,000 deportations took place in Trump's first three years1\n\nIn the final year of his presidency, Trump deported an additional 186,000 immigrants1\n\nThe total for Trump's full presidency was just under 1 million deportations1\n\nBiden Administration (2021-2024)\n\nDeportation numbers have increased significantly under Biden:\n\nIn less than 26 months, the Biden administration's Department of Homeland Security made over 5 million arrests1\n\nThe Biden administration is deporting people at a rate 3.5 times higher each month than under Trump1\n\nIt's important to note that the exact year-by-year breakdown for the entire period from 2000 to 2024 is not provided in the given search results.
