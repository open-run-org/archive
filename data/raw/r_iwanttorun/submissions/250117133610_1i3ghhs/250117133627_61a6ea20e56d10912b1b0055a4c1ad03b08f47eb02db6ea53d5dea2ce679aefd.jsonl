I would leave everything behind from bank accounts to phone, withdraw all accounts to zero - might as well as the debt is already there, and then get one way ticket and go. \n\nLive in Australia but probably would want to fly to another country to do it. Japan would be the best. Risks associated would be that immigration cops might eventually find out and that is a whole different story, however willing to take the risk as it might not be in 10yrs if I live under someone’s roof in remote rural japan and tent to their rice fields. Sounds like a dream. Would consider Yakuza or prostitution as well.
