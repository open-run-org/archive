desperate to get my two dogs out of China but the airline will only allow one dog per passenger. So if anyone is heading towards Canada or Washington state and doesn’t have a flight yet, I will pay for the ticket (and of course all of the dogs expenses) in exchange for being able to attach a dog to your flight. I will be on the same plane so I can take care of all of the paperwork, check-in process, and the customs for the dogs. Please reach out if you or anyone you know would be interested in this offer\nETA: I never expected this to receive so much support and positivity and especially never expected the awards. Truly thank you so much everyone who has been reaching out to help, I’m in tears at how amazing everyone is being. I’ve spent years fostering, rescuing, and even transporting animals to different countries to ensure they get to loving homes so the idea of losing either of my dogs is devastating to me. I cannot describe how much your support means to me. Please feel free to share this post and my offer in wechat groups. I have an extra ticket through another airline that sadly won’t allow the dogs through so if there’s a couple or parent/child duo looking to get to Vancouver I’d also be willing to find their tickets to Vancouver while I take the longer flight. I wouldn’t be able to help as much with the process but I would of course cover all the costs and provide all the necessary paperwork. My dogs mean more to me than anything in the world and my ultimate goal is to make sure they are safe. I really can’t express enough how grateful I am for all of the support everyone has shown, I’m beyond overwhelmed and within a few short hours this has grown beyond anything I imagined. Thank you, thank you, thank you\n\nETA: Unfortunately after contacting the airline there was only one space available for a dog left. I have since booked that flight and am now looking desperately for someone available to fly a dog from Shanghai to Vancouver after October 1st 2022. I will be trying to get my highly trained dog (one is legitimately trained but doesn't have all of the paperwork as of yet) qualified to fly as a service dog as he already has the training and meets qualifications to fly with me as such. if anyone has any information about flying with a service dog out of shanghai I would be incredibly grateful for your insight. Again, I will pay for the complete flight, with dog fees included. Additionally if anyone is available to foster a dog from may 7 to October, I would pay for all of the cost of care (including food, vet fees, grooming, and possibly compensation for boarding) please contact me if you are available or interested in either of these roles (flight or fostering). I am absolutely willing to make it worth your time and effort\n\nUpdate: there are no more spaces for dogs on any flights until October. One of my two dogs will be able to fly with me as my service dog but the other will spend the next few months at a pet hotel that I trust where the staff genuinely cares about dogs and sends me updates and videos every two days. I’m now in search of someone willing to fly with him in October or September (of course I’d prefer sooner than later). All of his documentation will be taken care of, fees paid, and I will pay for the plane ticket of the person flying with him. I’d prefer that he fly into Vancouver B.C. Or Seattle but as long as he makes it into North America, I’ll find a way to collect him. Again, thank you everyone for the support, kindness, and awards.","selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’m desperate to get my two dogs out of China but the airline will only allow one dog per passenger.
