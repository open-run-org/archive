It was a big challenge and I doubt many Chinese people actually prefer Western lifestyle.\n\nMy friend approached me today and right off the bat, he said he want to get out of China. It was bit of a shock. Because he was a researcher back in the UK and he went back to China at the height of the pandemic in March 2020 just before UK lockdown. At the start of the pandemic, he was very paranoid, refused to go to offices and had a big breakdown of relationships with his manager. The memorable conversation he had with his manager is the following:\n\nXiao Wang: The covid is killing people in Wuhan and it is so dangerous. I am so scared contracting covid on the train and in the office, no one wears face mask and there is no protection for me. I am scared and I refuse to come to work. I will be working from home.\n\nHis manager was pissed: Xiao Wang!! We watch the news as well. It is just a flu, stop being paranoid and get your ass back to work or else.\n\nXiao Wang refused and stand strong.\n\n Xiao Wang worea  hazmat suit everywhere he went in the UK(Imagine the scene) and he left everything in the UK and ran for his life to China. (he forfeited his deposit for his flat cos he did not pay for the remainder of his contract）\n\nHe got a good job at a research centre for FAANG for software development in Minhang. He is paid almost half-million RMB per year. Not bad tbh. He had talked very favorably about his life in Shanghai and how much he enjoyed it.\n\nI was more curious than amused. I asked him why though. The pandemic lockdown in Shanghai will end at some point, everything will hopefully get back to normal. Why go back to UK while you have everything set up so well in Shanghai. His job is secure with good benefits and security, not some Chinese startup. The working hours is decent at Faang in Shanghai.\n\nHe said he is very disappointed with Shanghai this time and the pandemic has changed everything.
