I have met many fellow international students who chose nursing just for the PR. And they are suffering. \n\nFirst of all, nursing is tough. No, the studies aren't hard. Nor is it hard to be on your feet for a long time. The hard part is dealing with the patients. You will be dealing with actual people and not all of them would be kind.\n\nFor your first year placements, you would be likely placed in aged care. There you would have to assist people with going to the bathroom. Clean poop, pee and vomit. You would need to learn to take blood samples and insert catheters. First of all, old patients are the worst. They would verbally abuse you. Sometimes even physically.  You won't be able to do much as often they have dementia and so they won't be charged. You would have to deal with disgusting bodily fluids. Deal with bad smell every day. And you would still have to be kind and professional. \n\nAlso one of my friend had an old lady who once threatened the staff with a knife. Then they called the police, and the police gave her a small shock to knock her unconscious. She died. And the police officer was charged and he got in trouble.\n\nAlso you would have to deal with the patients family all the time. Sometimes they would fight and curse at you. You would have to handle all that professionally. \n\nAlso graduate roles in nursing are competitive here in Australia. Especially in the cities. Here in Adeliade most graduate roles have 100+ applicants. And most international students I know are only able to secure jobs in aged care in regional towns. So a white small town and old people makes the most racist environment. \n\nAlso you would have to complete about 3 months of placements before you graduate. And they would be unpaid and you won't be able to work during them. Also you would be observed closely and if you don't put in effort during the placements they will fail you. They won't hesitate. Cause in healthcare, it's about life or death. And you are dealing with real people with emotions. Also real people who can be absolute assholes.\n\nWhat Australia needs is experienced nurses. Or else you won't get a job easily. \n\nBut if you are already planning to become a nurse. Australia would be the better place for it. \n\nAlso if you are going into nursing from a non-medical background. There would be 90%+ chances of Visa rejection. \n\nEdit: Guys you can study nursing even if you have a different background. But your chances of refusal of visa would be very very high. You gotta have a strong SOP(statement of purpose). And trust me 90% of my indian nursing are the ones who came to Australia and changed their course. And now they are regretting it as nursing is freaking hard.
