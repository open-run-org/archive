The last 5 years I was living abroad in many different cities, such as Sevilla and Berlin for example.\nTbh, I think people are pretty receptive in Berlin. It’s a multicultural city and even if u aren’t gonna have the most committed relationship (DISCLAIMER ‼️: when I use this word I don’t refer only to be boyfriend/girlfriend, more like any type of friendship/relationship), people is very friendly and always try to have some contact with others.\n\nI made friends mostly with Asian people: Pakistani, japanese, Indian, etc… And I learnt they are the most respectful with me, care about me and also funny and gentle.\n\nSince I came back to my home city, I’m trying to make these kind of friends. I realized how lonely I feel here —left everything that I build in other place bc I thought how easily it would be to make new connections. And I was totally wrong. Here in Madrid, even if u can find people from other countries (MOSTLY CHINESE), u can tell e-v-e-r-y-b-o-d-y doesn’t want to include new people in their circles / people that it’s not presented by a really really closed one. I like dancing, I tried to make friends with some and got: nothing. I like kpop, I tried to make friends with people that also likes it and got: nothing.\n\nSo since I really like Chinese culture (I studied about it, tried to be respectful with them), I decided that it will be nice to meet some. It my mind it sounds good, bc I get to now more about their culture and also, I can create a respectful connection with people that are foreigners as I was (and I actually still feel even if it’s supposed to be “my city”).\n\nLong story short, I decided to download Meeff but everybody just wants to 👌🏻👈🏻💦. Changed to Tantan, but only meet people living in Paris, China, etc. I think right now, I really need these cultural exchange AND also go out of my house, that’s what I’m looking for: having someone to go for a city walk, talk a lot / be in silence doing our own stuff, and enjoy time together.\n\nBut yesterday, while I was celebrating Chinese new year with my two female close friends, I found myself trying to justify to them why I am in Tantan. And started to overthink about this topic. I’m even so ashamed  didn’t told anybody close to me, just them.\n\nSomeone have some tips for me or smt that wants to share? :( Or if someone lives abroad, idk being friends if they are coming soon here! I just want friendships.\n\n👁️: it’s my first time posting in Reddit !","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"iwanttorun","subreddit_id":"t5_42jf61","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/iwanttorun","subreddit_subscribers":43667,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Do I have an Asian fetish?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"ups":1,"upvote_ratio":1,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/iwanttorun/comments/1igs0i5/do_i_have_an_asian_fetish/","user_reports":[],"view_count":null,"visited":false,"wls":null}
