这种想法铁傻逼，我认识的差学校润美国的大有人在，有一藤校商科精英（笑死）以为自己藤校无敌了，结果毕业的时候哭爹喊娘怎么也留不下来
但人家毕竟藤校人上人，回国也是特权阶级，绝大多数人都不是

>>>>> I did. Having participated some clubs, ends up just emailing all day.  On top of that, we also got some group projects. I’ve also tried hard to make friends in that. But here’s the problem, when you made some friends(at least I think them as mine),you paid time and energy. But they can’t or unwilling to get involved in your job applying or some shit. You end up being alone in getting a job.

The most ideal extent I expect would be they can just get me a job which I know is not that practical. So as long as they can generously introduce me to the hr or manager can be sweet enough

>>>>>>>> In Western societies the relationship between employer and employee tend to be more distant. Depending on what country your in this could range from mild to extreme. Employers in Germany for instance have a very strict divide between personal and professional life, to the extent that employers expect you not to bother them with emails or calls outside of work regardless of circumstance. Employees expect the same.
