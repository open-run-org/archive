>> Appoint one family member to be the point of contact with hostage-takers and media
>> 
>> 
>> Discuss a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a scam).
>> 
>> 
>> Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.
