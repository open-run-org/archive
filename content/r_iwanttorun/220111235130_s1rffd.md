>> Faking asylum is a big no no for anyone has some self-respect. There are many English speaking developed country for you to live. I for one do not wanna live in America and have no interests visiting USA. I will consider Canada, Australia, Singapore, take your pick. Immigration is not end all and be all thing, even u go back to China, save more money and skill your up, when things settle, you can still emigrate to the West if this is your end goal. I have too many friends got stuck in immigration system in USA and languish in the process for a decades, for what end?

>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>> China compared with NK is freer, but if caught, they definitely would be sent back, then this kind of "freer" doesn't apply to them. So for North Koreans, China is the same as that cursed land. Then you can see that Singapore is quite opposite, Chinese won't live in terror about when they would be sent back to China, even though Singapore isn't that "free" as the US.
>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>> When we talk about "freedom" it's more about to what extent can a specific person make choices and change the environment at his will or for the most benefits. Also, freedom the word in some contexts is another word for open, which means the bigger environment the society and the country are open for all different thoughts behaviors and values.
>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>> Singapore is an island country and also one of the main transit hubs in the world, which makes the country quite open to the rest world, and thus a free country. You can leave whenever you want and you can receive messages from any corner of this planet in real time. All of this makes Singapore more attractive than China as an immigration destination.
