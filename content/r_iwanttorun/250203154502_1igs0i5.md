I’m 23yo F and currently living back in my home city (Madrid, Spain). The last 5 years I was living abroad in many different cities, such as Sevilla and Berlin for example.
Tbh, I think people are pretty receptive in Berlin. It’s a multicultural city and even if u aren’t gonna have the most committed relationship (DISCLAIMER ‼️: when I use this word I don’t refer only to be boyfriend/girlfriend, more like any type of friendship/relationship), people is very friendly and always try to have some contact with others.

I made friends mostly with Asian people: Pakistani, japanese, Indian, etc… And I learnt they are the most respectful with me, care about me and also funny and gentle.

Since I came back to my home city, I’m trying to make these kind of friends. I realized how lonely I feel here —left everything that I build in other place bc I thought how easily it would be to make new connections. And I was totally wrong. Here in Madrid, even if u can find people from other countries (MOSTLY CHINESE), u can tell e-v-e-r-y-b-o-d-y doesn’t want to include new people in their circles / people that it’s not presented by a really really closed one. I like dancing, I tried to make friends with some and got: nothing. I like kpop, I tried to make friends with people that also likes it and got: nothing.

So since I really like Chinese culture (I studied about it, tried to be respectful with them), I decided that it will be nice to meet some. It my mind it sounds good, bc I get to now more about their culture and also, I can create a respectful connection with people that are foreigners as I was (and I actually still feel even if it’s supposed to be “my city”).

Long story short, I decided to download Meeff but everybody just wants to 👌🏻👈🏻💦. Changed to Tantan, but only meet people living in Paris, China, etc. I think right now, I really need these cultural exchange AND also go out of my house, that’s what I’m looking for: having someone to go for a city walk, talk a lot / be in silence doing our own stuff, and enjoy time together.

But yesterday, while I was celebrating Chinese new year with my two female close friends, I found myself trying to justify to them why I am in Tantan. And started to overthink about this topic. I’m even so ashamed  didn’t told anybody close to me, just them.

Someone have some tips for me or smt that wants to share? :( Or if someone lives abroad, idk being friends if they are coming soon here! I just want friendships.

👁️: it’s my first time posting in Reddit !

>> I say I am a person who feels out of place in this city because I have lived abroad for a long time and interacted with people from different cultures. There are many Pakistanis, Japanese, etc., and I think they are all very helpful people. But I don't know if it's wrong to actively seek out Chinese friends (since this is the largest community in Madrid).

>> Mmmn… here, we use that word when someone is generally fetishizing an Asian, no matter woman or man. The truth is, I don't know if it's necessary to say it but I'm a woman and I don't care if I talk to a woman or a man (in a certain sense, maybe I prefer a woman because we can understand each other about "female problems").

> If you want to make some Chinese friends, I suggest you go to Rednote小红书, where you can make friends with some overseas Chinese students in Spain. You can treat it like a language exchange. Generally speaking, it may be easier to make friends with overseas students than with Chinese-Spanish people because they may have a fixed group of friends from growing up there. Additionally, Rednote has more female users, so you might feel more comfortable than on Tantan, which is mainly used for hookups

>> Your answer seems very sweet to me 😭🤍 Honestly, I love talking to foreigners (it doesn't matter what nationality), but I really like listening to people of Chinese origin speak precisely because of the cultural differences and because I like to deny the hoaxes that have been instilled in me since small.
>> 
>> For example, we had always been told that talking about politics/showing politics in China in public was prohibited, and it always seemed negative to me. But talking to people, I understand the point of view that it can be dangerous. I have a friend who did the university exchange in Beijing and Palestine just happened. She told me that although the Chinese government supports Palestine, they did not allow people to have the Palestinian flag displayed in the student residence. It's very interesting!

By the way on part of Chinese social media apps there also can be some abnormal guys，such as fanatic supporters of CCP, they are cringe and aggressive. I suggest that find Chinese friends on hellotalk or meet someone in reality. Have a good day

> 西班牙的中国人社区据我了解很大，会西班牙语的也不少，你遇的社交困难应该不会比这里给你建议的任何一个人要大。既然你想要现实朋友又嫌弃网上的人动机不纯，就应该出去多摸一点草。另外，我诚心发问，你在西班牙语社区也会看到中国人用英语问自己有white fetish吗？西班牙人怎么回复的？

> Pero te advierto, el círculo de los chinos es exclusivo, no por reza ni color, será por idioma, aún que hablan castellano, pero hay montón, montones de cosa no se puede explicar en castellano.
