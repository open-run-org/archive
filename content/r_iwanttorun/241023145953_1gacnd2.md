The deportation statistics for the United States from 2000 to 2024 show significant fluctuations over the years. Here's a breakdown of the available data:

Early 2000s

During the presidency of George W. Bush (2001-2008), approximately 2.0 million people were deported1.

Obama Administration (2009-2016)

The Obama administration saw a significant increase in deportations:

About 3.2 million people were deported during Obama's presidency1

In Obama's first three years in office, around 1.18 million people were deported1

Over 2.5 million undocumented immigrants were deported during his entire tenure1

Trump Administration (2017-2020)

Deportation numbers decreased during Trump's presidency:

Around 800,000 deportations took place in Trump's first three years1

In the final year of his presidency, Trump deported an additional 186,000 immigrants1

The total for Trump's full presidency was just under 1 million deportations1

Biden Administration (2021-2024)

Deportation numbers have increased significantly under Biden:

In less than 26 months, the Biden administration's Department of Homeland Security made over 5 million arrests1

The Biden administration is deporting people at a rate 3.5 times higher each month than under Trump1

It's important to note that the exact year-by-year breakdown for the entire period from 2000 to 2024 is not provided in the given search results. However, the data shows clear trends and significant differences between administrations. The Obama administration had the highest number of deportations, followed by a decrease during the Trump years, and then a sharp increase under Biden.

> 我觉得拜登政府是最狠的，以前没听说过把走线去美国的大陆人 包机送回去的；现在看到不少新闻。 拜登属于是不瞎BB，直接下狠手。
> 包括制裁大陆，加税等；特朗普在的时候BB很多。拜登不怎么宣传，但实际上对大陆的制裁一条没减少，反而增加。

>> 因为以前没有走线这个东西，22年才开始兴起，之前每年进入美国的中国非法移民都非常少，22才开始激增。而且包机接送回去是要求得到中国的允许的，之前中国政府对于走线的都是不承认他们身份，不接受遣返，后面看到走的人多了才接受
