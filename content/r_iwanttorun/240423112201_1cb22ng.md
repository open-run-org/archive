for anyone who's still in this country, if you're looking for a partner for English learning, please reach out to me. I'm on approximately intermediate level, and I plan to pass TOEFL exam this year. For further details about my background, please refer to the post I sent in r/language_exchange.

also, for the sake of privacy and security, I'll prefer Telegram (although it requires a telephone number to register, it's generally one of the safest IM apps I guess :)
