在run to japan评价支那irl那群粉蛆被reddit封禁，这段话送给reddit社区的垃圾白左

I haven't broken any rules. I have every right to express my disgust at China's fanatical nationalism. East Asian peoples, once destined for independence, are being persecuted by Chinese nationalism because of Western betrayal. Westerners have turned a blind eye and are censoring independence-related discussions. White leftist online communities like Reddit are completely siding with the Chinese Communist Party. I cannot describe my anger at your indifference, hypocrisy, and shamelessness. If there is a God in this world, you should go to hell.
