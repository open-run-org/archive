Hi

As you may know and be one of them, people in the East Asia have been fascinated with Japan-originated idolatry contents indurstry.

Yesterday I visited Saitama Super Arena for a certain reason, and I heard some people speak Chinese(Mandarin?). now it's no longer rare nor strange.

However, it's still less frequent for such Japanese 2D idols to hold their live performance in China proper or somewhere else aborad, except for Vtubers. 

What do you think of this? what do you think would be a key point to the promotion and export of Japan's live performance industry? Do you reckon that you can help it anyway?

> You have to understand one thing, Japanese idol culture is an extension based on Japan's unique culture, which is why it fascinates people. The idol culture of other countries does not have the special temperament of Japanese idols, so few people are enthusiastic. Therefore, it is difficult to export idol culture because it is part of Japanese culture.

>> Yeah, you are totally right.
>> 
>> Japan's idol subculture has evolved in a peculiar way, especially after it began to be combined with Japan's anime-oriented subculture/consumerism(アキバ系文化).
>> 
>> Its style might be (controversially) compared to personal cult. It's often said that Japanese idol fans share some kind of "closed bubble circle" where they have the same feeling of "me fostering that lovely/handsome but still immature idol". 
>> the sense of mutual growth, and buying goods can be likened to "tribute".
>> 
>> As opposed to this, other idol industries(especially K-pop) are just the export of excellency/expertise of performance, so they are forbidden to exhibit their amateurism.
>> 
>> Well, what I meant in OP was, how could we export and transplant this "personal cult" fan economy? though this style is very Japanese, its attractive power is still strong toward foreigners  considering Vtubers' success.

>>> Humanity has worshiped idols since ancient times, thus giving birth to religions and Semitic monotheistic religions, namely Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The Indo-European peoples gave birth to the polytheistic religions of Nordic mythology and Indian epics. This all involves idolatry. The influence of religion in atheistic society has declined, so the objects of people's idol worship have become celebrities, baseball players, and two-dimensional idols. Even communism, which claims to be materialistic and resists religious idol worship, is still worshiping idols. Lenin and Stalin are their idols.

>>> The economic space for fans to export personality cults should be very small, with the three major religions occupying most of the attention. In a secular society, live broadcasters and short video producers in various small circles occupy space. They also have a fan economy of personal worship. In my personal opinion, two-dimensional idols will remain a niche circle in the future.

It might be helpful for 2d idols producers like Bushiroad and BandaiNamco to adopt China's unique and effective manners like live commerce in order to transplant themselves in Greater China Market(including southeastern asia), and optimise their revenue in Japan too.

Every アイドルマスターシリーズ smartphone game is not available in other regions such as Australia and the USA. Fxcking Bandai Namico, can you just try to make them available in other regions? It is not like there are no people who can read Japanese outside of Japan. With a bit of reading and VPN, people can still register a JP Google account, but why bother?
