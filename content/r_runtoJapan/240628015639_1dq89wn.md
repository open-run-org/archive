> Other than salads, I observed Japanese eat very little fresh vegetables. In restaurants, some pickles are typically served with meals. Little fresh vegetables are served if any. For example, there's practically no fresh veggies in ramen. In supermarkets, I didn't find many varieties of fresh vegetables especially the leafy kinds such as spinach. Do you dislike vegetables or is it just a tradition, habit? Is salad considered a Japanese food or imported?
