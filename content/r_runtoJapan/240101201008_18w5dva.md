> Foreigners in Japan are not rare: [Number of foreign residents in Japan rises to record 3.2 million](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/10/14/japan/society/japan-foreign-population/). So you don't need to worry too much about your origin. I suggest that you learn Japanese and talk with local people on apps, such as Reddit, by yourself.
