Frankly speaking, I don’t understand why so many people think learn
English difficult. As a old Chinese says going, world on no difficult
thing, only afraid of people with heart. That’s to be said, if you work
hard enough, your English can become very good. For instance, when I was
a children, I study English everyday. When i go to school by bus, I
listen to English by earphone. I also often practice English with my
good friends, and my English teacher is very kind. She makes me feel at
home. Last but not least, if you have your own experience of learning
English, please don’t hastite to share with me. Your help is highly
appreciated.
