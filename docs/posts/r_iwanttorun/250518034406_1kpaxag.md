I would like to study registered nursing courses in Australia. One
reason is I would like to have a decent-paying job. Another cause is
that I want to accumulate related knowledge to care for my mother's and
my health. I have already gotten a bachelor's degree and a master's
degree in China. But I work at a private company and am afraid of age
discrimination. But I didn't take any courses about nursing. But I am
hesitant to go to Australia because of budget. Nowadays, I have no loans
of my house and car. But I just work for almost one year, so I did not
have so much money.
