Hi 你好! 

I am looking to speak with people who are studying their Master's degree in the US on a student visa on behalf of an Education Tech company. We would like to learn about the student experience before & after arriving in the US. 

The conversation will take about 1 hour (in English) on Google Meet and participants will receive a $35 USD gift card as a thank you for their time after the meeting.

If you or someone you know might be interested, here's a link with more information & to sign up:

Thanks!
