>> Chancellor Karl Nehammer told national broadcaster ORF that if Germany introduced measures to send more immigrants back across their shared border, Austria would do the same, sending more people eastwards towards the Balkans.

>> The country on whose territory people land will screen them at or near the border. This involves identity and other checks – including on children as young as 6. 
>> Generally, people fleeing conflict, persecution or violence qualify for asylum. Those looking for jobs are likely to be refused entry. Screening is mandatory and should take no longer than seven days. It should lead to one of two things: an application for international protection, like asylum, or deportation to their home country.

>>> 进行边境检查不等于遣返你
>>> Can I get deported?
>>> In principle, if you are underage and unaccompanied, you may not be deported from Germany. Only if your parents, another caretaker, or a specific facility for children and adolescents in your home country officially guarantees to take care of you, the German law (§58 of the residence Act) permits your deportation. 
>>> 
>>> Dublin Regulation does not apply to unaccompanied minors, which means you may not be deported to another European country. In other words, you can stay in Germany, even if you have been registered (e.g., fingerprinted) in another EU country.

>>>> Between 1 January and 31 October 2023, 2,338 children (under 18 years) were deported to third countries or transferred to another state under the Dublin Regulation.These measures usually involve that children are taken into custody for a few hours on the day the transfer takes place. Furthermore, 335 minors were returned to neighbouring countries after being refused entry on the territory, out of which 120 were unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians.

>> Starting Monday, 16 September 2024, checks at all of Germany’s land borders will be temporarily reintroduced. This includes Germany’s western and northern borders. Border checks are already in place at Germany’s borders with Poland, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. These will continue unchanged.
