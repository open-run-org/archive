Hello,

I am looking for someone who would like to practice with me english language. Post it here because I think here might found someone who might be interested in it too. I am from Poland and think about chatting mostly to get better in vocabulary and grammar. We could use Whatsapp.

Feel free to PM me if you are interested in.
