> Wrong place for you to ask. This is a Chinese-based community where Chinese is the primary language to be used(Community rule#1). Most people here don’t speak English anyways so you might not be able to get an answer. You might want to check [https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/) for advices from English users

> You’re in the wrong place. [r/runtoJapan](https://www.reddit.com/r/runtoJapan/) is full of Chinese people who want to escape from the evil land that is China. Japan’s just the start. Who knows the final destination?
