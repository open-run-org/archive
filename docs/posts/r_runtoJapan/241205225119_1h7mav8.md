I have a 16 day trip to Kyushu ( Dec. 7-23) and will be renting a car (no snow tires, just snow socks) and driving around Kyushu. 

So far have the following:

Booked so far: 

Day 1 (12/7): Arrive in Fukuoka 
Day 2 (12/8): 1 day in Fukuoka/Itoshima 
Day 3-5 (12/9-12/11): 3 days in Nagasaki 
Day 6 (12/12): 1 day in Takachiho 

Considering: 

Day 7-8 (12/13-12/14): 2 days in Miyazaki City (is this worth it Mid-December?) 
Day 9 (12/15): 1 day in Kirishima/Ebino 
Day 10-11 (12/16-12/17): 2 days in Kagoshima/Sakurajima Day 
12-16 (12/18-12/22): 5 days in Fukuoka Day 17 
(12/23): Depart Fukuoka

What changes would you suggest to my itinerary for December (it's pretty fukuoka heavy at the backend)?

Should add a trip to Aso? was concerned about snow/ ice on the mountain roads, as wasn't able to rent a car with snow tires or all-wheel drive (but do have snow socks). I'm mainly concerned that the landscape won't be worth it if it's all dead grass, and one of the horse ranches contacted are only giving 10-20 minutes rides since the weather won't be good for riding they said. 

Should skip Miyazaki and spend more time in Kagoshima, or add a trip to Kumamoto? I'm not very interested in shrines or castles.

Thank you for the help!

> It usually doesn't snow this far down the south. Mt. Aso is worth going all year round if you enjoy outdoors stuff. In a timed trip like this I would probably skip it tho.
